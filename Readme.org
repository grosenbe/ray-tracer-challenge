This repository contains code I have written while working through Janis Buck's
/The Ray Tracer Challenge/.

* Getting Started
** Building the Project
   To run it on Ubuntu, first run the [[file:install_build_prereqs.sh][install_build_prereqs.sh]]
   file, and then run [[file:ci_build.sh][ci_build.sh]] to build the project and run the tests.
